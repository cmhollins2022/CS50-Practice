### Algorithms

How to find 0 in an array of numbers in memory? Only by opening each door (in our "lockers") our computer has to methodically figure out which locker
has the number 0.

### Searching

How is a program better designed than another?
- The quality of the code
- The quality of the preformance

**Efficiency of Algorithms** - Running time can be quantified by _"Big O"_ Notation.
- When the numbers become so big, we can use different algorithms combined with "Big O" Notation to better optimize the code.
- A way to describe running time in mathematical notation.
### Common Running Times
- O(n^2)
- O(n log n)
- O(n)
- O(log n)
- O(1)
