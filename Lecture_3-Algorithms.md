### Algorithms

How to find 0 in an array of numbers in memory? Only by opening each door (in our "lockers") our computer has to methodically figure out which locker
has the number 0.

How is a program better designed than another?
- The quality of the code
- The quality of the preformance

**Efficiency of Algorithms** - Running time can be quantified by _"Big O"_ Notation.
- When the numbers become so big, we can use different algorithms combined with "Big O" Notation to better optimize the code.
- A way to describe running time in mathematical notation.
### Common Running Times
(Big O is on the order of (that is, an "upper-bound") for how many steps an algorithm might take. (On the order of, so many steps.)

- O(n^2)
- O(n log n)
- O(n)
- O(log n)
- O(1)


Lower-Bound Notation - Ω (Omega)
- Ω(n^2)
- Ω(n log n)
- Ω(n)
- Ω(log n)
- Ω(1)

Big θ (Theta) is used when... you have a case where both the upper-bound on an algorithm's running time is the same as the lower-bound.
- θ(n^2)
- θ(n log n)
- θ(n)
- θ(log n)
- θ(1)
