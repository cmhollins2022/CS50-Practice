# Lecture 2 - Arrays

__Preprocessing - "Make" vs Clang__ - "Finds and replaces" the #includes and "copy and pastes" it into the code.
- Clang: The compiler that converts the source code to machine code.
- "Make": Automates this process, and is a useful tool to make things easier for when the code becomes more complicated. It "makes" it all happen.
  - "-o" tells clang to "output" the file... ```clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50```

__Compiling__ - Take code in the computers memory, then converts it into the assembly language.
__Assembling__ - To assemble code is turned into source code, (0's and 1's).
__Linkning__
